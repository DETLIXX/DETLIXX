<h3>Something about me</h3>
<p>At 13, I started coding with C#. I made a few fun apps, but later shifted to learning Discord bot development. While it was enjoyable, I didn't see much opportunity in it. In 2018, I got into game development with Unity/Unreal Engine, creating games and seeking job opportunities. Now, I work as a Full Stack Web Developer for a mid-range company in Slovakia.</p>
